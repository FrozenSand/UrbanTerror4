Rules
---------------------

Please follow these basic rules in order to keep this place nice:

- Do not insult, troll or harass anyone
- Do some [small research](https://github.com/FrozenSand/UrbanTerror4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) before posting a new issue to avoid duplicates
- Do not "UP" the issues yourself, it won't make us process them faster
- Do not use ALL CAPS - we are not blind (yet)


Reporting Issues
---------------------

If you encounter a bug while using Urban Terror 4, please first check that [a similar issue hasn't been opened yet](https://github.com/FrozenSand/UrbanTerror4/issues).
