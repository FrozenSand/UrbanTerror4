Guidelines
---------------------

Please follow these basic rules in order to keep this place nice:

- Do not insult, troll or harass anyone
- Do a [small research](https://github.com/FrozenSand/UrbanTerror4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) before posting a new issue to avoid duplicates
- Do not "UP" the issues yourself, it won't make us process them faster


Reporting Issues
---------------------

If you encounter a bug while using Urban Terror, please first check that [a similar issue hasn't yet been opened](https://github.com/FrozenSand/UrbanTerror4/issues).

If your bug is not reported, please provide us the following information:

- What platform you were using when experiencing the bug (Windows, Linux, Mac OSX)
- The version of your platform (Windows 7, OSX 10.9...)
- A short and descriptive title of your bug
- A detailed description of your bug and **steps needed to reproduce it**
- A few screenshots if possible - they can easily be drag&drop'ed in your issue description
- A **complete** output of your game console

Please place huge logs using tools like [Gist](https://gist.github.com) or [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com).

Feature Requests
---------------------

While we always appreciate new feature requests, please note that we are heavily working on **Resurgence** and we are probably not going to implement *huge* changes to Urban Terror anymore.
Nevertheless, a section of our forums is dedicated to suggestions, feel free to post [there](http://www.urbanterror.info/forums/forum/57-4x-suggestions/).
